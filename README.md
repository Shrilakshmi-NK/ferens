A code comparing platform for beginner coders 


This is a platform where beginner coders can compare a standard error-free code and their practice code. It uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript for a simple but user-friendly interface. It compares the two codes given by the user, one of which is correct and the other is practice code written by the user. It compares each line and points out the differences, making it easy for students to locate their mistakes. We plan to incorporate an AI model to provide more information on the code, enhancing the students' understanding of the concepts using the platform.
